YOU’VE GOT ME
YOU'VE GOT ME
YOU’VE GOT ME SPEECHLESS
WHERE YOU BEEN LATELY
WAITED FOR YOU ALL DAY
WAITING FOR YOU TO USE THE KEY
THAT OPENS MY PLACE
MY HEART STARTS TREMBLING
AS I HEAR YOUR FOOTSTEPS PACE
LOCK OPENED, DOORKNOB TURNED
THERE APPEARS YOUR FACE
GOING OUT MY HEAD I THINK I’M LOSING ALL MY MIND
DRIVE ME CRAZY, BURNING CANDLES, MAKING LOVE ALL NIGHT
FEEL SO STRANGE, IT FEELS SO CRAZY TO BE IN YOUR WORLD
IN YOUR ARMS, LOST FOR WORDS, YOU'VE GOT ME
YOU'VE GOT ME, YOU'VE GOT ME
YOU'VE GOT ME, YOU'VE GOT ME
YOU’VE GOT ME, YOU’VE GOT ME
YOU’VE GOT ME
SPEECHLESS
LAYING SO CLOSELY
I FEEL YOUR SKIN RUBBING AND TOUCHING ME
ONLY SWEAT BETWEEN US
FEELING YOU KISSING AND PLEASING ME
I RUB YOUR BACK
I KISS YOUR NECK
I KNOW THAT YOU LOVE WHEN WE TOUCH LIKE THAT
I CAN FEEL YOU NEED ME
FEEL SO GOOD TO ME, FEEL SO GOOD TO ME
GOING OUT MY HEAD I THINK I’M LOSING ALL MY MIND
DRIVE ME CRAZY, BURNING CANDLES, MAKING LOVE ALL NIGHT
FEEL SO STRANGE, IT FEELS SO CRAZY TO BE IN YOUR WORLD
IN YOUR ARMS LOST FOR WORDS YOU'VE GOT ME
YOU'VE GOT ME, YOU'VE GOT ME
YOU'VE GOT ME, YOU'VE GOT ME
YOU’VE GOT ME 
SPEECHLESS
YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES
SPEECHLESS
ALL I CAN SAY IS…YES, YES, YES,

I AIN’T MAD AT YOU, IT’S JUST MY CLYDE
WAY I WEAR MY HAT TO THE SIDE
WAY I LEAN REAL LOW WHEN I RIDE
THAT’S WHY MY MINDS, THEY LIKE MY WALK
MY ACCENT FROM NEW YORK

ALL OF OUR CONVERSATIONS
ALL OF YOUR SWEET PAGES
THEY'RE NEVER LONG ENOUGH
WHEN IT'S TIME FOR ME TO LEAVE
IT'S SO HARD TO SAY GOOD-BYE
I NEVER WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE

I REMEMBER WHEN YOU USE TO TAKE ME ON A BIKE RIDE EVERYDAY ON THE BAYOU 
(YOU REMEMBER THAT? WE WERE INSEPARABLE)
AND I REMEMBER WHEN YOU COULD DO NO WRONG
YOU'D COME HOME FROM WORK AND I JUMPED IN YOUR ARMS WHEN I SAW YOU
I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU (I WAS SO EXCITED, SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU)
BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME I OVERCOME
AND I'M SO PROUD OF WHAT YOU'VE BECOME
YOU'VE GIVEN ME SUCH SECURITY
NO MATTER WHAT MISTAKES I MAKE, YOU'RE THERE FOR ME
YOU CURE MY DISAPPOINTMENTS AND YOU HEAL MY PAIN
YOU UNDERSTOOD MY FEARS AND YOU PROTECTED ME
TREASURE EVERY IRREPLACEABLE MEMORY AND THAT'S WHY…
I WANT MY UNBORN SON TO BE LIKE MY DADDY
I WANT MY HUSBAND TO BE LIKE MY DADDY
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE MY DADDY
AND I THANK YOU FOR LOVING ME
I STILL REMEMBER THE EXPRESSION ON YOUR FACE
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT I'D BEEN ON A DATE AND HAD A BOYFRIEND 
(MY FIRST BOYFRIEND, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN YOUR FACE)
I STILL REMEMBER I CAUGHT YOU CRYING ‘CAUSE OF MY TATTOO
COULD HAVE SAID BEYONCE I TOLD YOU SO
INSTEAD YOU SAID YOU'D GET ONE TOO 
(EVEN MY MAMA SAID Y'ALL GET ONE JUST LIKE MINE)
WORDS CAN'T EXPRESS MY BOUNDLESS GRATITUDE FOR YOU
I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO
YOU'VE GIVEN ME SUCH SECURITY
NO MATTER WHAT MISTAKES, I KNOW YOU'RE THERE FOR ME
YOU CURE MY DISAPPOINTMENTS AND YOU HEAL MY PAIN
YOU UNDERSTAND MY FEARS AND YOU PROTECTED ME
TREASURE EVERY EXTRAORDINARY MEMORY AND THAT'S WHY…
I WANT MY UNBORN SON TO BE LIKE MY DADDY
I WANT MY HUSBAND TO BE LIKE MY DADDY
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE MY DADDY
AND I THANK YOU FOR LOVING ME
EVEN IF MY MAN BROKE MY HEART TODAY
NO MATTER HOW MUCH PAIN I'M IN, I WILL BE OKAY
CAUSE I GOT A MAN IN MY LIFE THAT CAN'T BE REPLACED
FOR THIS LOVE IS UNCONDITIONAL IT WON'T GO AWAY
I KNOW I'M LUCKY
KNOW IT AIN'T EASY
FOR MEN WHO TAKE CARE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES
LOVE IS OVERWHELMING
LORD WHY DID YOU PICK ME
CAN'T STOP MY TEARS FROM FALLING
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH DADDY
THANK YOU, YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH FOR ME. 
I LOVE YOU DADDY.
I GET SO EMOTIONAL DADDY, EVERY TIME I THINK OF YOU
I GET SO EMOTIONAL DADDY, EVERY TIME I THINK OF YOU
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE MY DADDY
NO ONE ELSE REPLACE MY DADDY...

prettyHurtsLyrics = <<-PRETTYHURTSLYRICS
MAMA SAID 
YOU’RE A PRETTY GIRL
WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD
IT DOESN'T MATTER
BRUSH YOUR HAIR
FIX YOUR TEETH
WHAT YOU WEAR
IS ALL THAT MATTERS
JUST ANOTHER STAGE
PAGEANT THE PAIN AWAY
THIS TIME I'M GONNA TAKE THE CROWN 
WITHOUT FALLING DOWN DOWN DOWN
PRETTY HURTS 
WE SHINE THE LIGHT ON WHATEVER'S WORST
PERFECTION IS A DISEASE OF A NATION
PRETTY HURTS, PRETTY HURTS
PRETTY HURTS
WE SHINE THE LIGHT ON WHATEVER'S WORST
WE TRY TO FIX SOMETHING 
BUT YA CAN'T FIX WHATCHA CAN'T SEE
IT’S THE SOUL THAT NEEDS SURGERY
BLONDER HAIR 
FLAT CHEST
TV SAYS
BIGGER IS BETTER
SOUTH BEACH
SUGAR FREE
VOGUE SAYS
THINNER IS BETTER
JUST ANOTHER STAGE
PAGEANT THE PAIN AWAY
THIS TIME I'M GONNA TAKE THE CROWN 
WITHOUT FALLING DOWN DOWN DOWN
PRETTY HURTS 
WE SHINE THE LIGHT ON WHATEVER'S WORST
PERFECTION IS A DISEASE OF A NATION
PRETTY HURTS, PRETTY HURTS
PRETTY HURTS 
WE SHINE THE LIGHT ON WHATEVER'S WORST
WE TRY TO FIX SOMETHING 
BUT YA CAN'T FIX WHATCHA CAN'T SEE
IT’S THE SOUL THAT NEEDS A SURGERY
BRIDGE
AIN'T GOT NO DOCTOR OR PILL THAT CAN TAKE THE PAIN AWAY
THE PAINS INSIDE AND NOBODY FREES YOU FROM YOUR BODY
IT'S MY SOUL IT'S MY SOUL THAT NEEDS SURGERY
IT’S MY SOUL THAT NEEDS SURGERY
PLASTIC SMILES AND DENIAL CAN ONLY TAKE YOU SO FAR
THEN YOU BREAK WHEN THE FAKE FACADE LEAVES YOU IN THE DARK
LEFT WITH SHATTERED MIRRORS AND THE SHARDS 
OF A BEAUTIFUL PAST
PRETTY HURTS 
WE SHINE THE LIGHT ON WHATEVER'S WORST
PERFECTION IS A DISEASE OF A NATION
PRETTY HURTS, PRETTY HURTS
PRETTY HURTS 
WE SHINE THE LIGHT ON WHATEVER'S WORST
WE TRY TO FIX SOMETHING 
BUT YA CAN'T FIX WHATCHA CAN'T SEE
IT’S THE SOUL THAT NEEDS SURGERY
PRETTY HURTS, PRETTY HURTS…….
WHEN YOU ARE ALONE ALL BY YOURSELF
WHEN YOU’RE LYING IN YOUR BED
REFLECTION STARES RIGHT INTO YOU
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH YOURSELF?
STRIPPED AWAY THE MASQUERADE
THE ILLUSION HAS BEEN SHED
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH YOURSELF?
YES

AND I'VE BEEN DRIFTING OFF OF KNOWLEDGE
CAT-CALLS ON CAT-WALKS, MAN THESE WOMEN GETTING SOLEMN
I COULD SING A PSALM FOR A SOLOMON OR SALAMANDER
WE TOOK A FLIGHT AT MIDNIGHT AND NOW MY MIND CAN'T HELP BUT WANDER
HOW COME?
SPOON-FED PLURALIZED EYES TO FIND THE BEACHES IN THE FOREST
WHEN I'M LOOKING OFF THE EDGE, I PREACH MY GUT IT CAN'T HELP IGNORE IT
I'M CLIMBING UP THE WALLS CUZ ALL THE SH-- I HEAR IS BORING
ALL THE SH-- I DO IS BORING
ALL THESE RECORD LABELS BORING
I DON’T TRUST THESE RECORD LABELS, I’M TOURING 
ALL THESE PEOPLE ON THE PLANET WORKING 9 TO 5 JUST TO STAY ALIVE
THE 9 TO 5 JUST TO STAY ALIVE…. 
ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE PLANET WORKING 9 TO 5 JUST TO STAY ALIVE

I KNOW IF I'M ON TO YOU, I'M ON TO YOU
ON TO YOU, YOU MUST BE ON TO ME

MY WICKED TONGUE, WHERE WILL IT BE?
I KNOW IF I'M ON TO YOU, I'M ON TO YOU
ON TO YOU, I'M ON TO YOU
ON TO YOU, YOU MUST BE ON TO ME
YOU WANT ME?
I WALK DOWN THE HALLWAY
YOU LUCKY?
THE BEDROOM'S THE WRONG WAY
SLAP ME, I'M PINNED TO THE DOORWAY
KISS, BITE, FOREPLAY
MY HAUNTED LUNGS
GHOST IN THE SHEETS
I KNOW IF I'M HAUNTING YOU, YOU MUST BE HAUNTING ME
MY WICKED TONGUE, WHERE WILL IT BE?
I KNOW IF I'M ON TO YOU, YOU MUST BE ON TO ME

CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE:
WE TEACH GIRLS TO SHRINK THEMSELVES
TO MAKE THEMSELVES SMALLER
WE SAY TO GIRLS, YOU CAN HAVE AMBITION
BUT NOT TOO MUCH
YOU SHOULD AIM TO BE SUCCESSFUL BUT NOT TOO SUCCESSFUL
OTHERWISE YOU WILL THREATEN THE MAN
BECAUSE I AM FEMALE I AM EXPECTED TO ASPIRE TO MARRIAGE
I’M EXPECTED TO MAKE MY LIFE CHOICES ALWAYS KEEPING IN MIND
THAT MARRIAGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
MARRIAGE CAN BE A SOURCE OF JOY AND LOVE AND MUTUAL SUPPORT
BUT WHY DO WE TEACH GIRLS TO ASPIRE TO MARRIAGE AND WE DON’T TEACH BOYS THE SAME
WE RAISE GIRLS TO SEE EACH OTHER AS COMPETITORS, NOT FOR JOBS OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
WHICH I THINK CAN BE A GOOD THING
BUT FOR THE ATTENTION OF MEN
WE TEACH GIRLS THAT THEY CANNOT BE SEXUAL BEINGS IN THE WAY THAT BOYS ARE

TOOK THAT RING OFF
OH NOW THE FUN BEINGS
DUST YOURSELF OFF AND YOU'LL LOVE AGAIN
FIND A NEW MAN
NOW YOU SINE, AND YOU'RE FINE LIKE IT'S MY TIME
YOU TOOK THAT RING OFF
MAMA YOU LIVE AND LEARN, THAT'S JUST THE WAY LOVE GOES
ALWAYS KNOW THAT YOU GOT A DAUGHTER
THAT'S OH SO PROUD YOU TOOK THE HIGH ROAD
YOU USED TO DRESS AND FIX YOUR HAIR
YOU'D ALWAYS SMILE THROUGH YOUR TEARS
IN THE MIRROR YOU WOULD STARE
AND SAY A PRAYER
LIKE I WISH HE SAID I'M BEAUTIFUL
I WISH THIS DIDN'T HURT AT ALL
I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT HERE
I WAS ONCE THE ONE WHO HAD HIS HEART
AND THEN YOU HAD ENOUGH AND YOU 
TOOK THAT RING OFF
YOU TOOK THAT RING OFF
SO TIRED OF THE LIES AND TRYING, CRYING AND FIGHTING 
TOOK THAT RING OFF
OH NOW THE FUN BEGINS
DUST YOURSELF OFF AND YOU'LL LOVE AGAIN
FIND A NEW MAN
NOW YOU SHINE, AND YOU’RE FINE LIKE IT'S MY TIME
YOU TOOK THAT RING OFF
AFTER ALL YOUR TEARS
AFTER ALL THAT PAIN’S ALL CLEARED
AFTER ALL THEM YEARS
WE CAN START ALL OVER AGAIN MAMA
NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE
LETTING GO IS NEVER THE END MAMA
WE CAN LOVE AGAIN
THIS IS WHERE FREEDOM BEGINS MAMA
SO PUT YOUR LOVE ON TOP
KEEP ON SHINNING, PUT YOUR LOVE ON TOP
IT’S YOUR TIME TO PUT YOUR LOVE ON TOP
EVERYBODY PUT YOUR LOVE ON TOP
HEY, LOVE ON TOP 
HEY, LOVE ON TOP
IT’S YOUR TIME TO PUT YOUR LOVE ON TOP, GIRL
YOU SO FINE, PUT YOUR LOVE ON TOP
IF YOU’RE GOING THROUGH IT JUST KNOW IT'S CALLED GOING THROUGH IT.
YOU’RE NOT GOING TO GET STUCK THERE. 
YOU’RE NOT GOING TO DIE, YOU’RE GOING TO SURVIVE.

YOU CAN TASTE THE DISHONESTY, IT’S ALL OVER YOUR BREATH
AS YOU PASS IT OFF SO CAVALIER, BUT EVEN THAT’S A TEST
CONSTANTLY AWARE OF IT ALL, MY LONELY EAR
PRESSED AGAINST THE WALLS OF YOUR WORLD
PRAY TO CATCH YOU WHISPERING
I PRAY YOU CATCH ME LISTENING
I’M PRAYING TO CATCH YOU WHISPERING
I PRAY YOU CATCH ME
I’M PRAYING TO CATCH YOU WHISPERING
I PRAY YOU CATCH ME LISTENING
I PRAY YOU CATCH ME
NOTHING ELSE EVER SEEMS TO HURT LIKE THE SMILE ON YOUR FACE
WHEN IT’S ONLY IN MY MEMORY, IT DON'T HIT ME QUITE THE SAME
MAYBE IT’S A CAUSE FOR CONCERN, BUT I'M NOT AT EASE
KEEPING MY HEAD TO THE CURB
PRAY TO CATCH YOU WHISPERING
I PRAY YOU CATCH ME LISTENING
I PRAY TO CATCH YOU WHISPERING

HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SLOW DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
BACK UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
STEP DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
CAN’T YOU SEE THERE’S NO OTHER MAN ABOVE YOU
WHAT A WICKED WAY TO TREAT THE GIRL THAT LOVES YOU
HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SLOW DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SOMETHING DON’T FEEL RIGHT
BECAUSE IT AIN’T RIGHT
ESPECIALLY COMING UP AFTER MIDNIGHT
I SMELL YOUR SECRETS
AND I’M NOT TOO PERFECT 
TO EVER FEEL THIS WORTHLESS
HOW DID IT COME DOWN TO THIS
SCROLLING THRU YOUR CALL LIST
I DON’T WANT TO LOSE MY PRIDE BUT I’MA F---- ME UP A BITCH
KNOW THAT I KEPT IT SEXY
YOU KNOW I KEPT IT FUN
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT I’M MISSING? MAYBE MY HEAD FOR ONE
WHAT’S WORSE LOOKING JEALOUS AND CRAZY, JEALOUS AND CRAZY
OR LIKE BEING WALKED ALL OVER LATELY, WALKED ALL OVER LATELY
I’D RATHER BE CRAZY
HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SLOW DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
BACK UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
STEP DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
CAN’T YOU SEE THERE’S NO OTHER MAN ABOVE YOU
WHAT A WICKED WAY TO TREAT THE GIRL THAT LOVES YOU
HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SLOW DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
LET’S IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT 
THAT YOU NEVER MADE A NAME 
FOR YOURSELF MASTER WEALTH THEY HAD YOU LABELED AS A KING
NEVER MADE IT OUT THE CASE
STILL OUT THERE MOVING IN THEM STREETS
NEVER HAD THE BADDEST WOMEN IN THE GAME UP IN YOUR SHEETS
WOULD THEY BE DOWN TO RIDE, NO
THEY USED TO HIDE FROM LIE TO YA
BUT Y’ALL KNOW WE WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER 
SO I FIND YOU AND HOLD YOU DOWN
HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SLOW DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
BACK UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
STEP DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
CAN’T YOU SEE THERE’S NO OTHER MAN ABOVE YOU
WHAT A WICKED WAY TO TREAT THE GIRL THAT LOVES YOU
HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SLOW DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
BABE IT'S SUCH A SHAME
YOU LET THIS GOOD LOVE GO TO WASTE
I ALWAYS GIVE THAT TOP TIER 5 STAR
BACK SEAT LOVIN IN THE CAR 
LIKE MAKE THAT WOOD HOLLY LIKE A BOULEVARD
WHAT'S WORSE LOOKING JEALOUS AND CRAZY, JEALOUS AND CRAZY
OR LIKE BEING WALKED ALL OVER LATELY, WALKED ALL OVER LATELY
I’D RATHER BE CRAZY
HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
SLOW DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
BACK UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
STEP DOWN, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
CAN’T YOU SEE THERE’S NO OTHER MAN ABOVE YOU
WHAT A WICKED WAY TO TREAT THE GIRL THAT LOVES YOU
HOLD UP, THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU
